                                    <p>I'm Melih. 22-year-old MIS student at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University. My path with coding crossed first when I was a freshman at the university but I did not delve into it back then. Afterwards, I got the chance to attend a hackathon in Berlin at the end of 2018 where I found a chance to get exposure to coding a bit more. I also had the opportunity of getting to know Re:Coded and its people and attended Re:Coded Web Development Bootcamp in 2020. I'm currently a full-time 3rd grade student who aspires to be an experienced Front-End Web Developer. If you still care who I am, why not having a coffee together? (of course in Zoom) ðŸ™ƒ</p>
